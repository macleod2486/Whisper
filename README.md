Whisper
=======

Secure chat program based in Python that uses the RSA public-key/private-key
encryption for sending and recieving messages.  With a decentralized model 
of server-client relations.

This currently is still very alpha but will mature over time.

Instructions

Just start the client file in the src and use the help menu command.
Configure your username within the file in the etc/ directory
Then generate your keys, then give the public key file with a .pub extension to your friend/relative/someone you're going to chat with and vice versa.  
Once complete start the server with the server button then connect to your friends server.

Current near future goals
- ~~Merge both the server and client script files together~~
- ~~Encrypt the private keys and require a password to unlock~~
- Make more efficient
- Allow multiple users to connect
- Send files
