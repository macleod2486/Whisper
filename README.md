Whisper
=======

Secure chat program based in Python that uses the RSA public-key/private-key
encryption for sending and recieving messages.  With a decentralized model 
of server-client relations.

This currently is still very alpha but will mature over time.

Currently the only way it works is by starting the server and client script file independentely.

Current near future goals
- Merge both the server and client script files together
- Encrypt the private keys and require a password to unlock
