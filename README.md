Whisper
=======

Secure chat program based in Python that uses the RSA public-key/private-key
encryption for sending and recieving messages.  With a decentralized model 
of server-client relations.

This currently is still very alpha but will mature over time.

You first start the server to recieve messages or start the client and connect.


A better help menu will be created once the basic features are decided upon
